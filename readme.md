# BattleShip The Game
Battleship is a two-player strategy game (versus Human or Computer). Each player tries to
sink the opponent’s fleet by guessing the positions of their ships. Strategy and luck both
play a part in winning. You will implement the Battleship game in C++ with interactive
menus, scoring, and file-based leaderboard management
